WasteWise is built around the focus of helping people to manage their waste more wisely, through supporting recycling, and encouraging waste management that benefits the environment overall. Our platform will be used to operate multiple designated waste deposit locations around Subang Jaya, specifically waste stations and rebox units. Our users may deposit both inorganic and organic waste within these locations. The collected waste would then be processed by Waste-to-Energy Power Plants (PLTSa) to be converted into energy, essentially recycling them.

We're developing the platform using the Agile framework. With the use of other software engineering tools for management and development such as Trello and GitHub, we will be performing an iterative backlog refining and multi-layered sprints of planning, designing, developing, as well as continuous testing before deploying our product. We will be pushing updates our GitHub repository frequently to maintain transparency towards our clients and users (stakeholders) while also gathering feedbacks from them on the fly.
